# Detection Email Forwarding Rules Attack


## Ne Zaman Kullanılır

- Proaktif olarak şu göstergeleri ararken: Tespit etme email forwarding rules attack in the environment
- threat intelligence sonrasında indicates active campaigns using these techniques
- incident response sırasında to scope compromise related to these techniques
- EDR veya SIEM alarmları ilgili göstergeleri tetiklediğinde
- Periyodik güvenlik değerlendirmeleri ve purple team egzersizleri sırasında

## Ön Gereksinimler

- EDR platform with process and network telemetry (CrowdStrike, MDE, SentinelOne)
- SIEM with relevant log data ingested (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)
- Sysmon Dağıtılmış with comprehensive configuration
- Windows Security Event Log forwarding enabled
- Threat intelligence feeds for IOC correlation

## İş Akışı

1. **Formulate Hypothesis**: Define a testable hypothesis based on threat intelligence or ATT&CK gap analysis.
2. **Identify Data Sources**: Belirle: which logs and telemetry are needed to validate or refute the hypothesis.
3. **Execute Queries**: Run Tespit queries against SIEM and EDR platforms to collect relevant events.
4. **Analyze Results**: İncele: query results for anomalies, correlating across multiple data sources.
5. **Validate Bul:ings**: Distinguish true positives from false positives through contextual analysis.
6. **Correlate Activity**: Link Bul:ings to broader attack chains and threat actor TTPs.
7. **Document and Report**: Record Bul:ings, update Tespit rules, and recommend response actions.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1114.003 | Email Forwarding Rule |
| T1114.002 | Remote Email Collection |
| T1098.002 | Additional Email Delegate Permissions |

## Tools & Systems

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| CrowdStrike Falcon | EDR telemetry and threat Tespit |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Advanced hunting with KQL |
| Splunk Enterprise | SIEM log analysis with SPL queries |
| Elastic Security | Tespit rules and investigation timeline |
| Sysmon | Detailed Windows event monitoring |
| Velociraptor | Endpoint artifact collection and hunting |
| Sigma Rules | Cross-platform Tespit rule format |

## Common Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1**: BEC actor creating forwarding rule to external email
2. **Scenario 2**: Compromised account with rule deleting security alerts
3. **Scenario 3**: Inbox rule forwarding CEO emails to attacker mailbox
4. **Scenario 4**: OAuth app abuse creating transport rules for data collection
